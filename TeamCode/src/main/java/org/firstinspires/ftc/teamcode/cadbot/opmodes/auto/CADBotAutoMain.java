/*
 * This file includes an autonomous file for the goBILDA® StarterBot for the
 * 2025-2026 FIRST® Tech Challenge season DECODE™. It leverages a differential/Skid-Steer
 * system for robot mobility, one high-speed motor driving two "launcher wheels," and two servos
 * which feed that launcher.
 *
 * This robot starts up against the goal and launches all three projectiles before driving away
 * off the starting line.
 *
 * This program leverages a "state machine" - an Enum which captures the state of the robot
 * at any time. As it moves through the autonomous period and completes different functions,
 * it will move forward in the enum. This allows us to run the autonomous period inside of our
 * main robot "loop," continuously checking for conditions that allow us to move to the next step.
